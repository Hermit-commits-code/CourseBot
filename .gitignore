# PyInstaller
#  Usually these files are written by a python script from a template
#  before PyInstaller builds the exe, so as such it is not recommended
#  to edit them manually, but instead edit their respective templates
#  and then re-run the script.
#
#  If you do need to edit them manually, be sure to include this in your
#  source code control system.
# .pyi file is for type hint stubs.
