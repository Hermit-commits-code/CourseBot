# Mobile App Development Roadmap

## Objective

Develop a mobile version of the app using Kivy and ensure seamless synchronization between the desktop and mobile versions.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Environment Configuration

- **Objective**: Set up the development environment for Kivy and ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.
- **Tasks**:
  - Activate the virtual environment.
  - Install Kivy and its dependencies.
  - Verify installation with a basic Kivy app.

### Phase 2: Design Mobile App UI

- **Objective**: Create a user-friendly and responsive UI for the mobile app.
- **Tasks**:
  - Design the layout for the mobile app, considering smaller screen sizes and touch interactions.
  - Implement the designed UI using Kivy's layout and widget system.

### Phase 3: Implement Core Features

- **Objective**: Develop the core features of the desktop app for the mobile version.
- **Tasks**:
  - User Authentication
    - Implement user login and registration functionality.
  - Course Management
    - Implement features for adding, viewing, and managing courses.
  - Reminders and Notifications
    - Implement reminders and notifications for courses.

### Phase 4: Set Up Backend Server

- **Objective**: Implement a backend server to handle data synchronization and other backend functionalities.
- **Tasks**:
  - Choose a web framework (e.g., Flask, Django, FastAPI).
  - Set up the server and create APIs for core functionalities (user authentication, course management, etc.).
  - Deploy the server on your Kubuntu 24.04 system.

### Phase 5: Data Synchronization

- **Objective**: Ensure data consistency and real-time updates across both the desktop and mobile versions.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement data synchronization using the backend server.
  - Ensure both desktop and mobile apps can read/write data to the server.

### Phase 6: Testing and Optimization

- **Objective**: Test the mobile app on various devices and optimize performance.
- **Tasks**:
  - Test the mobile app on different devices to ensure compatibility and performance.
  - Optimize the app for smooth performance and responsiveness.
  - Fix any bugs or issues identified during testing.

### Phase 7: Deployment

- **Objective**: Prepare the mobile app for deployment.
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up app store accounts (Google Play Store, Apple App Store).
  - Generate app build files (APK for Android, IPA for iOS).
  - Submit the app for review and publish it on the app stores.
